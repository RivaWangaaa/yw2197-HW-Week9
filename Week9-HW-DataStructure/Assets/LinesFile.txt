Get ready to ignite
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
Speak less than you know
To feel these feelings
You'll be the king of emotional management
You saw the signs but you ignored it
Getting away is essential
You will stumble into the happiness of your life
All the effort you are making will ultimately pay off
Good money habits can never start too early
The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese
Be on the alert to recognize your prime
Your road to glory will be rocky, but fulfilling
Patience is your alley at the moment
Don't worry too much
Nothing is impossible to a willing heart
The best things in life are free
Don't pursue happiness - create it
Nothing is so much to be feared as fear
All the things are difficult before they are easy
The real kindness comes from within you
A ship in harbor is safe, but that's not why ships are built
The wise man is the one that makes you think that he is dumb
The usefulness of a cup is in its emptiness
It takes less time to do a thing right than it does to explain why you did it wrong
A big journey will begin
You will enjoy good health
Practice gratitude every day
Respect the environment
Get on a good schedule
If your dream only includes you, it's too small
It's your game; make up your own rules
In five years, you will feel like a completely different person
You can have it all. Just not all at once
The more you trust your intuition, the more empowered you become
The stronger you become, the happier you become
Aging will treat you well
You get what you give
Dream bigger
Don't let yesterday take up too much of today
You are learning more from failure than from success
Go crazy
Knowing is not enough, you must apply
Perfect is imperfect
Security is mostly a superstition
The man who has confidence in himself gains the confidence of others
You are never too old to set another goal
To see what is right and not do it is a lack of courage
Fake it until you make it
Goals should never be easy
